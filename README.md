# ChatAppGUI
This is the GUI Client for the ChatApp server.  Built in WPF, this is Windows only.

If you do not already have a server, head over to https://github.com/petegregoryy/ChatApp and grab a server release.  Supported versions will be listed on the GUI releases page.

Once the server is running, enter the server address and port (Default 65432) and it will connect.
